      <h2>When do we use reported speech?</h2>
      <p>We use reported (indirect) speech to say what someone else said without quoting their exact words. Reported speech is useful when summarising conversations, telling stories, or reporting information.</p>

      <h2>How to create reported speech (key points)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Change the reporting verb and remove quotation marks. Common reporting verbs: <code>say / tell / ask</code>.</li>
        <li>Backshift the tense when the reporting verb is in the past (see common backshifts below).</li>
        <li>Change pronouns and time/place words when necessary (I → he/she, today → that day, here → there).</li>
        <li>Use <code>that</code> optionally after verbs like <code>say/tell</code>. For reported questions use <code>ask + if/whether</code> or <code>ask + wh-word</code>.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Common backshifts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Present simple → Past simple (I am → she was)</li>
        <li>Present continuous → Past continuous (I'm eating → he was eating)</li>
        <li>Present perfect → Past perfect (I have finished → she had finished)</li>
        <li>Will → Would (I will go → she would go)</li>
        <li>Can → Could; May → Might; Must → Had to (often)</li>
      </ul>
